        <ul>
            <li><strong>Hero Section:</strong> A brief introduction of myself, potentially a photo of myself, and a call-to-action button that moves the page down to my portfolio.</li>
            <li><strong>About Me:</strong> Personal bio of my background and education. Will also include my basic mission statement of what drives me in my web development experience. A sidebar will be included with a list of my technical skills.</li>
            <li><strong>Portfolio:</strong> This section will include a project gallery of thumbnails of projects that I’ve worked on. Each project will have a text box underneath that briefly lays out what the project is, the technology used to develop it, and my role in the project.</li>
            <li><strong>Contact Me:</strong> There will be pertinent links to my career pursuits (LinkedIn, GitHub). Following that will be a mailto link for my e-mail.  Underneath will be a basic contact form.</li>
